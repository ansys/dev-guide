Introduction
############

Through the PyAnsys project, Ansys provides Python libraries that
expose Ansys technologies to the Python ecosystem. These libraries 
are more than reusable scripts. They are clear, concise, and 
maintainable APIs and interfaces. Their useful functions, classes, 
and plugins eliminate the need to write scripts and code from scratch. 

These libraries play a vital role in:

- Application automation
- Machine learning
- Postprocessing
- Data visualization
- Workflow orchestrations
- Data manipulation and export


Purpose
#######
The PyAnsys project is the central site for:

- Ansys developers who want to create and "own" libraries
- Anyone in the Python community who wants to contribute to a 
  library
- Anyone who is interested in learning more about the PyAnsys 
  project and libraries

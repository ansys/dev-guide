Glossary of abbreviations
=========================

Like all technical documentation, the documentation for PyAnsys libraries
includes lots of abbreviations, which is a general term that also includes
acronyms and initialisms.

On the first use of an abbreviation that might be unfamiliar to the developer
community, the documentation for a PyAnsys library provides the longer word
or phrase. For your convenience, this page provides a glossary of all these
abbreviations.

A - B - C
---------

**ACE**

Ansys Customer Excellence: The Ansys organization responsible for ensuring
customer success with Ansys products.

**AEDT**

Ansys Electronics Desktop: An Ansys product with the best-in-class solvers
for electronics simulations.

**APDL**
APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language): A powerful structured scripting language
used to interact with the Ansys Mechanical solver. See also MAPDL, a fine element
analysis program driven by APDL.

**API**

Application program interface: A set of rules that enable different apps
to communicate with each other. An API is a type of software interface,
offering a service to other pieces of software.

**CI/CD**

Continuous integration/continuous delivery: The practice of automating the
integration of code changes from multiple developers into a single
codebase so that the code can be built, tested, and delivered to production-ready
environments for approval.

**CLA**

Contributor license agreement: An agreement defining the terms under
which intellectual property has been contributed to a project or company,
typically for software under an open source license.

**CRLF**

Carriage return, line feed: The invisible characters that the Windows
operating system uses to denote line endings in files.

D - E - F
---------

**DevEco*

Developer Ecosystem: The name of the Ansys team responsible for the
`Ansys Developer <https://developer.ansys.com/>_` portal.

**DNS*

Domain name system: A hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers,
services, and other resources on the internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
Just like a telephone directory translates names to phone numbers, DNS translates domain names
into IP addresses, which are numerical labels assigned to every device connected
to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

**DPF**
Data Processing Framework: An Ansys product that provides numerical simulation users
and engineers with a toolbox for accessing and transforming simulation data. With DPF,
you can perform complex preprocessing or postprocessing of large amounts of simulation
data within a simulation workflow.

**DRY**

Don't repeat yourself: A principle of software development aimed at reducing
repetition of software patterns, replacing them with abstractions or using
data normalization to avoid redundancy.

**EOL*

End-of-line: One or more invisible characters that denote line endings in files.
Each operating system manages EOL characters in its own way. Windows uses the
original DOS convention of a carriage return plus a line feed (CRLF), while
Linux and Mac use only a line feed (LF).

G - H - I
---------

**gRPC*

gRPC: A high performance, open source, universal Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.
gRPC can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support
for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication.


**IP*

Intellectual property: A category of property that includes intangible creations of
the human intellect. Of the many types of IP, the best known are patents, copyrights,
trademarks, and trade secrets.

Internet Protocol: The network layer communications protocol in the Internet protocol
suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables
internetworking and essentially establishes the Internet.

J - K- L
--------

**LF**

Line feed: The invisible character that the Linux and Mac operating systems use to
denote line endings in files.

M - N - O
---------

**MAPDL**

Mechanical APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language): A finite element analysis program
driven by APDL. APDL and MAPDL can be used for many tasks, ranging from creating
geometries for analysis to setting up sophisticated solver settings for highly complex
analyses. 

**OSS**

Open source software: Computer software that is released under a license in
which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change,
and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.
Open source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.

P - Q - R
---------

**PIM**
Product Instance Management: The PIM API is a gRPC API, enabling both library
and app developers to start a product in a remote environment and communicate
with its API. The PIM API is not intended to manage stateless services, to be
a job management system, or a fully featured service orchestration API. Its
purpose is to expose a minimum feature set for managing service-oriented apps.

**PMM**

Product marketing manager: Title of an Ansys person who can approve an open
source project for an Ansys product for public release.

**PyPA**

Python Package Authority: A working group that maintains a core set of software projects
used in Python packaging. The software developed through the PyPA is used to package,
share, and install Python software and to interact with indexes of downloadable
Python software such as PyPI, the Python Package Index.

**PyPI**
Python Package Index: A repository of software for the Python programming language.
PyPI helps you find and install software developed and shared by the Python community.

**REST**

Representational state transfer: A software architectural style that provides
interoperability between computer systems over the internet. REST is based on
simple and standardized protocols, like HTTP, which is the backbone of the
internet. It emphasizes a stateless client-server interaction, meaning each
request should contain all the necessary information to be understood by the
server, without relying on any previous interactions. This simplicity and
standardization make it easy for different systems to communicate and exchange
data effectively.

**RPC**

Remote procedure call: A powerful software communication protocol used in
distributed client-server programs. An RPC is a request message initiated
by a client program to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure
with supplied parameters. The remote server sends a response to the client,
and the app continues its process. RPC is more efficient than RST in terms of
speed, memory, and payload size. Typically, the use of REST should be limited
to short messages transferred via JSON files, and gRPC should be used for
large data transfers and bidirectional streaming.

**RMI**

Remote method invocation: An API that allows an object to invoke a method
on an object that exits in another address space, which could be on the same
machine or on a remote machine. The Java RMI is the object-oriented equivalent of
a remote procedure call (RPC) for Java, with support for direct transfer of serialized
Java classes and distributed garbage-collection.

S - T - U
---------

**SSH**

Secure shell protocol: A cryptographic network protocol for operating network
services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications
are remote login and command-line execution.

**TDD**

Test-drive development: A software development process that relies on software
requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed.
Software development is then tracked by repeatedly testing the software
against all use cases.

V - W - X
---------

**WSL2**

Windows Subsystem for Linux: A Windows development environment that enables
running a GNU/Linux environment, including most command-line tools, utilities,
and apps, directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional
virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

Content how-tos
===============

This section describes how to perform tasks related to contributing
to PyAnsys documentation. As indicated in earlier sections, PRs suggest
changes to the main codebase. Each PR undergoes a thorough review before
it can be approved and subsequently merged into the codebase.

Content writers typically contribute to the codebase in one of two ways:

- By reviewing PRs created by fellow contributors
- By creating PRs that add to or improve the documentation

Additionally, content writers can create issues and discussions on the **Issues**
page and **Discussions** page of a library's GitHub repository.

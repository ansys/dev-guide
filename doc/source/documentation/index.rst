API Documentation
#################
Good documentation drives library adoption and usage and is the
foundation for a good developer experience.  Even with the best
interfaces and the most functional product, no one will adopt the API
if they don't know how to use it or if they aren't convinced by the
documentation or examples they are presented with.

Good API documentation provides the following:

* Increased adoption and improved experience for the developers using
  the API or library.
* Reduction in the time spent on-boarding new users (both contributors
  and users of the project).
* Better maintenance of the code base.  The time spent reading the
  source is often orders of magnitude greater than the time spent
  writing it.  Well documented code (both in user-facing docstrings
  and developer comments) pays dividends in code maintenance.
* Reduces the amount of time spent understanding the features API.

The documentation for a PyAnsys library should contain the following

* Module, class, method, and function documentation strings.  See
  :ref:`docstrings`.
* Full examples gallery.  See `PyMAPDL Examples
  <https://mapdldocs.pyansys.com/examples/index.html>`_
* User guide.
* Link to this contributing guide.

Documentation Deployment
------------------------
Documentation for the PyAnsys project is hosted via `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_. Given the open-source nature of the project, documentation build by each PyAnsys library or project should be public and editable by users and the community at large.

After following the documentation build strategy contained within both
the `pyansys/template <https://github.com/pyansys/template/>`_ and
`pyansys-sphinx-theme
<https://github.com/pyansys/pyansys-sphinx-theme>`_ you will end up
with html documentation files contained within `doc/build/html`.

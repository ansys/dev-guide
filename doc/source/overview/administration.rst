Project Administration
######################
The PyAnsys project allows you to create your own workflows and 
interfaces to Ansys products using Ansys APIs. While using PyAnsys 
libraries requires that the relevant Ansys products are licensed 
either directly or indirectly, you can distribute your custom-made 
applications and workflows internally or externally.

Licensing and Approval
======================
To allow for commerical use, a PyAnsys library must use the MIT 
license. Because this license falls in the BSD-style license 
class, you do not have to provide any source code when releasing 
new software. To make your PyAnsys library suitable for commercial 
use, you need only to include the original MIT license in the 
reused code.

To view this license, see the `LICENSE` file in the root directory 
of this repository. This file must be included in the root 
directory of the repository for every PyAnsys library.

Project Approval
================
Exposing new Ansys technologies through the PyAnsys project is 
subject to an internal review and decision process. Reach out 
to Stephane Marguerin and Alexander Kaszynski for any requests.

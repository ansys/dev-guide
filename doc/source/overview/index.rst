The PyAnsys project is hosted on GitHub at `PyAnsys
<https://github.com/pyansys>`_. It contains several repositories with 
Python libraries that interface with Ansys products or services. 
To try out a library, visit one of these links:

* `PyAnsys Packages Overview <https://docs.pyansys.com/>`_
* `PyMAPDL`_
* `PyAEDT`_
* `DPF-Core <https://github.com/pyansys/DPF-Core>`_
* `DPF-Post <https://github.com/pyansys/DPF-Post>`_
* `Legacy PyMAPDL Reader <https://github.com/pyansys/pymapdl-reader>`_

If you want to create, develop, or contribute to a PyAnsys library,

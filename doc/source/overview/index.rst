Overview

Through the PyAnsys project, Ansys provides Python libraries that
expose Ansys technologies to the Python ecosystem. These libraries 
are more than reusable scripts. They are clear, concise, and 
maintainable APIs and interfaces. Their useful functions, classes, 
and plugins eliminate the need to write scripts interfacing with low
level APIs, allowing you to now interact with the product or service
at a high level in an object-orientated manner.

These libraries play a vital role in:

- Application automation
- Machine learning
- Postprocessing
- Data visualization
- Workflow orchestration
- Data manipulation and export

The libraries also include plugins and interfaces to the vast Python
ecosystem. Examples include:

- Arrays using `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_
- Data structures and tables with `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
- 2D visualization using `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
- 3D visualization using `PyVista <https://docs.pyvista.org/>`_
- Advanced scientific computing using `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_
- Machine learning using `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_

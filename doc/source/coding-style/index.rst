Coding Style
############

Coding Style refers to the different rules defined in a software project which
need to be followed when writing source code. These guidelines ensure that all
the source code is going to look the same across the different files of the
project.

The PyAnsys ecosystem is composed by multiple projects. To unify the coding
style among all projects, this coding style guideline was devised. 

PyAnsys libraries are expected to follow `PEP 8`_ and be consistent in style and
formatting with the 'big three' data science libraries: `NumPy`_, `SciPy`_, and
`pandas`_.
